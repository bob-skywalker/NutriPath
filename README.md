# NutriPath

A mobile diet-planning companion that **takes the pain out of logging**, **tailors every meal to your personal goals**, and **keeps you motivated** with game-like rewards and social accountability.

## 1. Core Tasks

- **Plan & Adjust** daily nutrition targets (calories, macros, micros) based on goals (weight loss, muscle gain, general health).  
- **Log & Record** what you eat in under 3 taps, with minimal friction.  
- **Reflect & Review** progress over time and quickly revisit “trouble spots” (meals you got wrong or skipped).

## 2. Key Features

### 2.1 Quick-Add Meal Tracker
- **Custom favorites grid**: Tap your pre-saved meals (e.g. “Breakfast Burrito,” “Chicken Salad”) to log instantly.  
- **Long-press edit**: Adjust portion size or macros, or add a new favorite from recent history.

### 2.2 Smart Meal Swap Engine
- **On-the-fly alternatives**: Generate healthier recipe swaps (“zoodles instead of pasta,” “chickpeas for extra protein”) with before/after macro comparisons.  
- **Goal-driven filters**: Pick “lower carbs” or “boost protein,” and see only the swaps that matter to you.

### 2.3 AR & Hybrid Logging Modes
- **Barcode + photo scan**: Snap or scan your food to auto-fill nutrition fields.  
- **AR portion estimator**: Use your camera to measure rough portions (“~1 cup”), then tap to log.  
- **Restaurant mode**: One-tap templates for common out-of-home combos (latte + bagel, sub sandwich, etc.).

### 2.4 Deep Personalization & Context
- **Flavor-profile matching**: Share your favorite spices or cuisines; get suggestions you’ll love.  
- **Allergy & preference swaps**: One-tap ingredient substitutions (e.g. cauliflower rice for white rice).  
- **Time-of-day adaptation**: Lighter breakfasts on busy mornings; protein-heavy dinners post-workout.  
- **Geo-aware grocery sync**: Auto-generate your shopping list based on pantry inventory and local stores.

### 2.5 Motivation & Gamification
- **Progress Milestone Badges**: “7-Day Logging Streak,” “Balanced Macro Master,” etc., with in-app notifications and social share cards.  
- **Micro-Challenges**: “Try 3 new veggies,” “No added sugar today,” each with small rewards.  
- **Streak Rescue Kit**: If you miss two days, get a “We’ve got you” quick-log suggestion to help you get back on track.

### 2.6 Social & Community
- **Buddy Cook-Alongs**: Schedule virtual cook-along sessions with friends.  
- **Team Quests**: Join “30-day whole foods” or “morning smoothie” challenges and chat in-app.  
- **Recipe Remix Sharing**: Post your tweaks (e.g. “my low-fat mac ’n’ cheese”) and up-vote favorites.

### 2.7 Post-Meal Review Workflow
- **“Review Later” Bookmark**: Flag meals or days where you struggled and surface them in a dedicated “Review” deck—like flash-cards for nutrition.  
- **Flash-card style review**: Flip through “What did I eat on Day 3?” and retake mini-quizzes on macros.

## 3. HCI Principles in Action

- **Visibility of System Status**: Persistent bubbles on AR scans; progress rings on streaks.  
- **Recognition over Recall**: Quick-add cards and preset restaurant modes surface common choices.  
- **Direct Manipulation**: Drag-and-drop pantry items into your plate, pinch to adjust portions.  
- **Personalization & Flexibility**: “Smart Swap” and flavor-profile tuning adapt to each user’s mental model.  
- **Motivation through Feedback**: Haptic ticks on scans, confetti bursts on badge unlocks, micro-challenges to sustain engagement.

## 4. Next Steps

1. **Low-Fidelity Sketches**: Wireframe the three key flows—Quick-Add, Smart Swap, Badge Unlock.  
2. **Medium-Fidelity Prototype**: Build these in Figma (or your prototyping tool), include AR overlay mock-ups.  
3. **Video Prototype**: Record a 5-minute walkthrough showing logging, swapping, badge flows, and the review workflow.  
4. **Final Evaluation**: Test with ~20 participants (SUS, task time, error counts, thematic interviews) before launch.
